# TCP client server in C.

## First attempt: 
- Wrote client and server as goofy as possible, added a bunch of error handlers.
- Incomplete; Server fails after client establishes connection.

## Second attempt: 
- Got it working, client and server are now connectnig to each other.
- I still have to fix one bug: server fails when client closes connection.
